# Simple-Grocery-List
A simple Python program that allows the user to add. remove, check off, and interact with a grocery list.

When the program is run, the user will be prompted to enter one of eight actions by inputting an integer between 1-8:

    1. Add Grocery Item
    
    2. View Current Grocery List
    
    3. Mark Grocery Item as Bought
    
    4. Remove Grocery Item
    
    5. Remove ALL Items
    
    6. Sort List Alphabetically
    
    7. Get Number of Items in List
    
    8. Exit
    
Actions 1, 3, and 4 also require the user to input the name of the item they wish to act on. 

The program can be run on any Python IDE.
